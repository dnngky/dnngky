- 👋 In case you’ve (somehow) skipped the large bold text under my profile picture, my name’s Dan!
- 🎓 I am a second-year student who takes a special interest in performing arts, am an avid fan of football, and pursuing computer science. Who says that these must be mutually exclusive?
- 🔍 I am currently looking to further optimise qubit mapping using approaches to the subgraph isomorphism problem.
- 📫 Feel free to reach out: dan.kynguyen2@outlook.com
